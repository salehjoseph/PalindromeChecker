# Palindrome Checker

## Overview

Build a Palindrome Checker that determines whether a word or phrase reads the same forwards and backwards. This project involves handling strings and performing checks to identify palindromes.

## What is a Palindrome?

A palindrome is a word or phrase that can be read the same way forwards and backwards, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing. For example, "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama" is a palindrome.

## Features

- **Alphanumeric Check**: Remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces, and symbols).
- **Case Insensitivity**: Convert all characters to the same case (lowercase or uppercase).
- **Palindrome Detection**: Check if the cleaned string reads the same forwards and backwards.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
3. Review and modify the code in `script.js` to customize functionality.
4. Test the palindrome checker with various inputs to ensure accuracy.

## Usage

- **Input**: Provide a string that you want to check for palindromes.
- **Processing**: The checker will remove non-alphanumeric characters and convert the string to a single case.
- **Output**: The checker will determine if the processed string is a palindrome.
